none of the above

### 3. Recommending items using a simple count based co-occurrence matrix can (check all that apply): ###

provide personalization

capture context (e.g., time of day)

**none of the above**

### 4. Recommending items using featurized matrix factorization can (check all that apply): ###

**provide personalization**

**capture context (e.g., time of day)**

none of the above

### 6. A store has 3 customers and 3 products. Below are the learned feature vectors for each user and product. Based on this estimated model, which product would you recommend most highly to User #2? ###


| User ID |   Feature vector   |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1	      | (1.73, 0.01, 5.22) |
| 2	      | (0.03, 4.41, 2.05) |
| 3	      | (1.13, 0.89, 3.76) |

| Product ID |	Feature vector    |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| 1	         | (3.29, 3.44, 3.67) |
| 2	         | (0.82, 9.71, 3.88) |
| 3	         | (8.34, 1.72, 0.02) |
